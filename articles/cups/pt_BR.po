If the permissions check boxes in the Administration section of the <application>CUPS</application> web interface do not seem to be working, another fix might be to manually backup the main <application>CUPS</application> configuration file located at <filename>/usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</filename> and edit the various configuration options and try different combinations of configuration options. One sample <filename>/usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</filename> to test is listed below. Please note that this sample <filename>cupsd.conf</filename> file sacrifices security for easier configuration; once the administrator successfully connects to the <application>CUPS</application> server and configures the clients, it is advisable to revisit this configuration file and begin locking down access."
